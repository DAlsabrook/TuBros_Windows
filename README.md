# TuBros Windows Project
The TuBros website was my first freelance project and a test of how quickly I could get a polished site launched. I wanted scalable React components and a future-proof build, so I chose Next.js for its server-side rendering and built-in image optimization. The client was non-technical and didn’t have specific goals for content or design, which gave me creative freedom. For the contact section, he requested SMS over email, so I had to figure out how to send SMS directly from the front end. Learning to integrate third-party tools with Cloudflare Workers to handle SMS was a valuable lesson in practical problem-solving.

<br/>
The client’s only design input was a business card with a black background and decorative scrollwork beneath the logo, which he wanted the website to reflect. I used this as a foundation, building the site’s look and feel around that card, starting with the hero section and expanding from there.

<br/>
Keeping the design straightforward was essential for delivering the info users would need—without any fluff. The focus was on showcasing what the client offers in a clean, minimal way, aligning with the goal of a no-nonsense, bare-bones site.

Giving the user the option to directly reach out to the owner via this form was important to keep a direct to client line open. I was able to have this form send its data directly to the owner via SMS.

Since most users searching for this business will be on mobile, responsiveness was key. It was important to keep the client’s clean look consistent across devices, ensuring an intuitive and seamless experience for every visitor.

<br/>
For a business that's thrived on word of mouth for the last 30 years, I wanted to give the client a way to showcase those trusted customer experiences.
